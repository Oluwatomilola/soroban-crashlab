# Maintainer Wave Playbook

This document defines how Soroban CrashLab is operated during Drips Wave cycles.

## 🌊 Wave 3 Specific Context
- **Contributor Limit**: Each contributor can resolve a maximum of **4 issues** across this entire org (down from 7 last wave). Keep an eye on assigning too many issues to a single applicant.
- **Application Rejections**: Explicitly and quickly **reject** applicants who are not a fit or if we are waiting for a specific profile. Do not leave them pending; rejecting them immediately returns their application quota.
- **24-Hour Review SLA Alert**: AI point appeals explicitly drop in when maintainers are unresponsive for >24 hours. Given our strict "Definition of Done", we risk automated points bypassing our review if we dawdle. Review inside 24h!

## Pre-wave checklist

1. Validate that each candidate issue has scope, acceptance criteria, and complexity.
2. Ensure issue labels are consistent:
   - `wave3`
   - `complexity:trivial|medium|high`
   - area labels such as `area:fuzzer`, `area:web`, `area:dx`
3. Confirm issue dependencies are explicit.
4. Keep an adequately sized open issue backlog ready for the new 4-issue org limit (i.e. more issues require spreading out to higher volume of distinct contributors).

## Assignment policy

- Prioritize first-time contributors on trivial and medium issues.
- **Do not** assign more than 4 issues historically to the same contributor across the org.
- Reject misaligned applications quickly using the Wave UI so contributors can reapply elsewhere.
- If no progress update is posted in 24 hours, request a status check and un-assign if unresponsive.

## PR review policy

Review inside 24 hours to prevent unnecessary automated appeals. Review in this order:

1. Correctness and safety
2. Adherence to the strict "Definition of Done" provided in the issue
3. Deterministic reproducibility of behavior
4. Test coverage
5. Clarity and maintainability

## Resolution policy

- If work quality is acceptable but merge is blocked for external reasons, resolve per Wave guidance so contributor effort is credited.
- Move partial work to follow-up issues with clear boundaries.

## Contributor SLA targets

These timers define the maximum response and review windows for every
participant in the Wave sprint. All times are wall-clock hours from the
triggering event.

| Event | Timer | Owner | Escalation after |
|---|---|---|---|
| New application received | 24 h | Wave maintainer | Wave lead at 36 h |
| Issue assigned — first contributor update | 24 h | Assigned contributor | Un-assign + re-open at 48 h |
| PR submitted — first maintainer review | 24 h | Assigned reviewer | Any available maintainer at 36 h |
| PR review comment — contributor response | 48 h | Assigned contributor | Stale label + ping at 60 h |
| Merge-blocked PR — external dependency resolved | 24 h | Blocking maintainer | Wave lead escalation at 36 h |
| New triage issue (unlabelled, unassigned) | 48 h | Triage maintainer | Wave lead at 72 h |

> **Why 24 h for PR review?** Drips Wave automated appeals trigger when
> maintainers are unresponsive for more than 24 hours. Missing this window
> risks automated point grants that bypass our Definition of Done review.

### Escalation path

1. **At threshold** — the owner posts a status update in the issue or PR.
   No action needed from maintainers if an update is present.
2. **At escalation timer** — any wave maintainer may step in, re-assign,
   or apply the `stale` label and request a response within 12 hours.
3. **After stale label + 12 h silence** — wave lead un-assigns, re-opens
   the issue for the next contributor, and notes the outcome in the wave log.
4. **PR review >24 h (automated appeal risk)** — any available maintainer
   must review immediately regardless of original assignment. Comment
   `reviewed-by: @<handle>` to mark ownership.

### Running the SLA check

Use `scripts/check-sla.sh` to surface open items past their SLA window:

```bash
# requires: gh CLI authenticated as a maintainer
bash scripts/check-sla.sh
```

The script lists open PRs with no review past 24 h and assigned issues
with no update past 48 h. It exits non-zero when breaches are found so
it can be wired into a CI schedule.

## Post-resolution feedback

- Leave practical, direct feedback.
- Highlight what was done well and what should improve.
- Keep comments specific to code and collaboration behavior.
